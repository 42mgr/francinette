# Francinette
A small and easy to use testing framework for the 42 C module

## Install:
Francinette has an automatic installer.

Copy the line bellow to your console and execute it. It will automatically download the repo,
create the necessary folders and alias, and install a python virtual environment dedicated to running this tool

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/xicodomingues/francinette/master/install.sh)"
```

The francinette folder will be under your `$HOME` directory (`/User/<you_username>/`)

## Update:
To update francinette run the command bellow

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/xicodomingues/francinette/master/update.sh)"
```

## Runnning:

If you are on a root of a project and under it you have the exercises, francinette should be
able to tell which project it is and execute the corresponding tests.

```
in: /C00 $> francinette
```

you can also use the shorter version of the command: `fran`

In the case above, francinette should run the tests in C00.

You can also use francinette to evaluate a project from github.

```
$> francinette git@repository.42.com/intra-uuid-8e9b82a1-59b4-43cd-ah34-639a79beeb5f-391f552
                             v
                  git url to clone the project from
```

It should also know to which project of this repo and run the corresponding tests

## Configuration / Usage

```
$> francinette -h
```
This shows the help message.

```
in: francinette/c00 $> francinette
```

This will execute the tests for the project c00

```
in: francinette/c00/ex00 $> francinette
```

This will execute the test only for ex00 of the project c00


```
in: francinette/c00 $> francinette -e ex01
```

This will execute the test only for ex01 of the project c00

```
$> francinette <a git repo with the c00 solved exercises>
```

It clones the git, and executes the tests from the `files` folder in the code clonned.


## FAQ

If you have any questions you know where to find me. Also, on slack under 'fsoares-'

#### I'm more advanced than the tests you have available. When are you adding more tests?

When I reach that exercise. You can also add them yourself. But for that you need to also
create a `C0X_Tester.py` file. (Also there is a need to change the function `guess_project`
in `main.py` to recognize the files for the that project)

#### This test that you put up is incorrect!

Well, you can change it yourself and create a pull request, or you can contact me so we can
change it together and be friends :)
